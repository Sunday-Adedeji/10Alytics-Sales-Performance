## Project Overview

This project explores a replicated 10Alytics sales dataset, analysed using Microsoft Excel to derive actionable business insights.

The objective was to demonstrate core Business Analyst skills using Excel-only tools:
Data cleaning & formatting
Excel Tables
Pivot Tables & PivotCharts
KPI creation
Dashboard automation
Slicer-driven analytics
Insight generation & recommendations

This analysis reflects how a Business Analyst transforms raw data into decision-ready intelligence for stakeholders.

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure
The dataset contains 34,000+ transactions across multiple fields:

Date, Year, Month

Customer Segment & Age Group

State / Location

Sales Person

Product Category & Sub-Category

Payment Option

📌 Dataset was provided for educational purposes by 10Alytics and has been fully cleaned and re-formatted.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1️. Profit Trend

📌 Profit surges sharply entering January 2016, peaks around April–May, then dips slightly mid-year.
This pattern indicates seasonal buying power—likely aligned to holiday periods, restocking cycles, or consumer financing patterns.

2️. Product Category Analysis
Phones generate the highest profit across the dataset, far exceeding Clothing and Accessories.
Phones are the company's core revenue driver. Low-margin categories like Accessories must be paired as bundles or optimised for cost reduction.

3️. Age Group Profitability
Adults and Youth dominate profit contribution.
Marketing should prioritise these age segments, targeting the two age groups for more revenue generation.
Product development can tailor offerings (e.g., trendy items for Youth, functional for Adults).

4️. Gender Distribution
Male → 52% of profit
Female → 48% of profit
Customer base is balanced. Marketing should remain gender-diverse and inclusive.

5️. State-Level Performance
Lagos, Abuja, and Akwa Ibom consistently outperform others.
These are high-value markets with strong purchasing power.
Optimal for inventory focus, expansion, and geo-targeted promotions.

6️. Salesperson Performance
Filters reveal strong performance from:
Chinazam, Remota and Feyisola
Top reps either manage premium customers or excel in high-margin product sales.
Sales process analysis can help replicate their methods across the team.

Chinazam sells significantly more Phones, indicating strong upselling tendencies. His strategy, along with those that yield similar results, can serve as a training template.

![Derick Dashboard]<img width="1280" height="442" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef99590-51c1-476f-b769-c7af262b23de" />

![Feyisola Dashboard]<img width="1280" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1825c78a-fa70-49e0-accd-5725d9973c8d" />

![Kenny Dashboard]<img width="1280" height="442" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdf8b3d3-1f7e-4514-9eb1-542831a1a963" />
Profit rose sharply for Kenny, suggesting strong customer engagement and an effective product mix. Kenny can be placed on higher-value accounts or asked to mentor junior reps.

![Remota Dashboard]<img width="1280" height="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee7e247-c4ab-4bc2-b1f1-ae674c5544f2" />
When filtering by Remota, Lagos loses dominance while Akwa Ibom rises, suggesting Remota has deeper penetration in secondary markets. This insight can inform territory planning.

![Segun Dashboard]<img width="1280" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83259ef2-9df5-4920-91d4-4f6153071dfa" />

![Suleman Dashboard]<img width="1280" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de278854-d1cf-4a7c-9582-4b7e445005f9" />
A decline in Suleman's performance suggests limited customer conversion or insufficient product match. Customer complaints can be reviewed, and inventory availability for this segment.


## 📌 Actionable Recommendations

1. Prioritise Phones as the primary revenue power house.

2. Launch targeted campaigns for Adults and Youth.

3. Expand distribution in Lagos, Abuja, and Akwa Ibom.

4. Study top-performing sales reps’ strategies to replicate success.

5. Bundle low-performing categories with high-performing ones.

6. Enhance digital payment channels. This is because the online payment option contributes the most revenue.

7. Use demand forecasting to reduce stockout risks in key regions.

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates how Excel alone can deliver powerful business intelligence. With structured cleaning, pivot tables, and interactive dashboards, a Business Analyst can drive:
+ Improved data-driven decision-making
+ Sales optimisation
+ Demand forecasting
+ Customer segmentation
+ Sales team performance benchmarking
